# Agent Creation & Management Documentation

## Overview

The Blackbird SDK provides a powerful agent creation system that allows users to build custom AI agents with specific personalities, capabilities, and behaviors tailored to their needs.

## Core Concepts

### Agent Components

- **Agent Config**: Configuration defining agent behavior and capabilities
- **Personality**: Predefined communication styles (Professional, Friendly, Analytical, etc.)
- **Capabilities**: Specific features the agent can use (File Processing, Web Search, etc.)
- **Custom Functions**: User-defined functions the agent can execute
- **System Prompts**: Instructions that guide agent behavior

### Agent Types

### Pre-built Agents

- **General**: Basic conversational agent
- **Finance**: Financial analysis and calculations
- **Legal**: Legal document analysis and research
- **Tech**: Code review and technical support
- **Research**: Web research and data analysis
- **Image Generator**: Image creation and editing

## Creating Custom Agents

The Blackbird SDK's agent creation system represents a sophisticated framework for building specialized AI agents that can be tailored to specific use cases, industries, and organizational needs. Unlike generic chatbots, these agents are designed with specific personalities, capabilities, and domain expertise that make them highly effective for targeted tasks.

### Understanding Agent Architecture

At its core, the Blackbird SDK agent system is built around several key components that work together to create intelligent, context-aware AI assistants:

**Agent Configuration Layer**: This is the foundation that defines how your agent behaves, what it knows, and how it responds. Think of it as the agent's DNA - it contains the personality traits, knowledge domains, and behavioral rules that make each agent unique.

**Capability System**: Rather than building monolithic agents that try to do everything, the SDK uses a modular capability system. Each capability represents a specific skill or tool that an agent can use, such as processing files, searching the web, or performing calculations.

**Function Integration**: Custom functions allow you to extend your agent's abilities beyond its built-in capabilities. This is where you can integrate your own business logic, external APIs, or specialized calculations.

## File-by-File Component Breakdown

### 1. Agent Types and Core Classes (`types.py`)

The `types.py` file serves as the foundational layer for the entire agent creation system. This file defines the essential data structures and enumerations that every agent uses.

```python
# Essential data structures for agent creation
from blackbird_sdk.creation.types import AgentPersonality, AgentCapability, AgentConfig

```

**AgentPersonality Enumeration**: This enum defines the communication styles and behavioral patterns your agent can adopt. Each personality type influences how the agent processes information and communicates with users:

- **PROFESSIONAL**: Ideal for business environments, legal consultations, or formal customer service
- **ANALYTICAL**: Perfect for research tasks, data analysis, or technical documentation
- **CREATIVE**: Best suited for content creation, brainstorming, or innovative problem-solving
- **SUPPORTIVE**: Excellent for customer support, training, or mentoring scenarios

**AgentCapability Enumeration**: These represent the functional modules that can be enabled for your agent. Each capability grants access to specific tools and integrations:

- **FILE_PROCESSING**: Enables document analysis, OCR, and multi-format file handling
- **WEB_SEARCH**: Provides real-time web search and information retrieval
- **CALCULATIONS**: Adds mathematical and financial calculation abilities
- **DATA_ANALYSIS**: Enables statistical analysis and data interpretation

**AgentConfig Dataclass**: This is the blueprint that holds all configuration details for your agent. It includes personality settings, system prompts, enabled capabilities, custom functions, and metadata. Understanding this structure is crucial because it's what you'll be building and customizing throughout the agent creation process.

### 2. Agent Builder System (`builder.py`)

The `builder.py` file implements the builder pattern, which provides an intuitive, fluent interface for constructing agents step-by-step. This approach makes agent creation both powerful and accessible.

### Understanding the CustomAgent Class

```python
# The CustomAgent class represents your deployed agent
class CustomAgent:
    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig, sdk_instance=None):
        self.config = config
        self.sdk = sdk_instance
        # Agent initialization logic

```

**Purpose and Functionality**: The `CustomAgent` class is the runtime representation of your configured agent. Once you've defined an agent using the builder pattern, this class handles the actual message processing, function calling, and interaction with the SDK backend.

**Message Processing Pipeline**: When your agent receives a message, it goes through a sophisticated processing pipeline:

1. **Prompt Construction**: The agent combines your custom system prompt with personality traits and any provided context
2. **Function Integration**: If your agent has custom functions, they're made available during processing
3. **Response Generation**: The message is processed using the configured AI model with your specified parameters

### The AgentBuilder Pattern

```python
# Fluent interface for building agents
agent = (create_agent("financial_advisor", "Personal financial planning assistant")
    .personality(AgentPersonality.ANALYTICAL)
    .system_prompt("Your detailed system prompt here...")
    .with_capabilities([AgentCapability.CALCULATIONS])
    .build(sdk)
)

```

**Why Use the Builder Pattern**: This design pattern offers several advantages:

- **Readability**: Each configuration step is clearly defined and self-documenting
- **Flexibility**: You can configure only the aspects you need, with sensible defaults for everything else
- **Validation**: Each step can validate inputs and provide immediate feedback
- **Extensibility**: New configuration options can be added without breaking existing code

**Configuration Methods Explained**:

- **`.personality()`**: Sets the communication style and behavioral patterns
- **`.system_prompt()`**: Defines the core instructions and context for your agent
- **`.with_capabilities()`**: Enables specific functional modules
- **`.temperature()`**: Controls response creativity vs. consistency (0.0-2.0 range)
- **`.max_tokens()`**: Sets the maximum length for agent responses
- **`.instruction()`**: Adds custom behavioral rules or formatting preferences

### 3. Template System (`templates.py`)

The template system provides pre-built agent configurations for common use cases, allowing you to quickly deploy specialized agents without starting from scratch.

```python
# Using pre-built templates
from blackbird_sdk.creation.templates import AgentTemplates

template = AgentTemplates.get_template("financial_analyst")

```

**Template Architecture**: Each template is carefully designed based on real-world use cases and best practices. Templates include:

- **Optimized System Prompts**: Crafted by domain experts to maximize effectiveness
- **Appropriate Capabilities**: Pre-selected tools that match the agent's intended use
- **Balanced Parameters**: Temperature and token settings tuned for the specific domain
- **Industry-Specific Instructions**: Custom rules and formatting preferences

**Available Template Categories**:

1. **Business \& Finance**: Financial analysts, investment advisors, accounting assistants
2. **Technology**: Code reviewers, technical writers, system architects
3. **Research \& Education**: Research assistants, tutors, academic writers
4. **Customer Service**: Support agents, sales assistants, community managers

**Customizing Templates**: While templates provide excellent starting points, you can modify any aspect:

```python
# Start with a template and customize
agent = (sdk.create_agent_from_template("financial_analyst")
    .name("crypto_specialist")
    .instruction("focus_areas", "Cryptocurrency and DeFi protocols")
    .temperature(0.2)  # More conservative for financial advice
    .build(sdk)
)

```

### 4. Agent Management System (`agent_manager.py`)

The agent management system handles the lifecycle of your deployed agents, including creation, monitoring, and cleanup.

```python
# Agent lifecycle management
from blackbird_sdk.agent.agent_manager import AgentManager

# Deploy and manage agents
sdk.deploy_custom_agent(agent)
response = sdk.send_message_to_custom_agent("agent_name", "message")

```

**Deployment Process**: When you deploy an agent, several things happen:

1. **Configuration Validation**: The system verifies that all required fields are present and valid
2. **Resource Allocation**: Memory and processing resources are allocated for the agent
3. **Function Registration**: Any custom functions are registered and made available
4. **Backend Integration**: The agent is connected to the processing backend

**Runtime Management**: Once deployed, agents are managed through:

- **Session Handling**: Each conversation maintains context and history
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and token usage tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic handling of transient failures
- **Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand

### 5. Session and Memory Management (`session_manager.py`)

The session management system provides enterprise-grade session handling, quota management, and usage tracking.

```python
# Enterprise session management
session = sdk.session_manager.create_session(
    user_id="enterprise_user",
    tier="professional",
    metadata={"department": "Research"}
)

```

**Session Architecture**: Each session represents a conversation context with specific:

- **User Identity**: Linking conversations to specific users or roles
- **Quota Limits**: Controlling resource usage per user or organization
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation
- **Context Persistence**: Maintaining conversation history and agent state

**Quota System Details**: The quota system tracks multiple resource types:

- **Token Usage**: Number of AI model tokens consumed
- **API Calls**: Number of requests made to the system
- **Storage**: File storage space used
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer amounts

**Implementation Benefits**:

- **Cost Control**: Prevent unexpected usage spikes
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support multiple organizations safely
- **Compliance**: Meet enterprise audit and tracking requirements
- **Performance**: Ensure system stability under load

## Advanced Implementation Patterns

### Custom Function Integration

When building sophisticated agents, you'll often need to integrate custom business logic or external services. The function system provides a clean way to extend agent capabilities:

```python
def calculate_roi(investment: float, returns: float) -> dict:
    """Custom financial calculation function"""
    # Your business logic here
    return {"roi_percentage": ((returns - investment) / investment) * 100}

# Integrate with agent
agent = create_agent("investment_advisor", "ROI calculation specialist")
    .with_functions([calculate_roi])
    .system_prompt("Use the calculate_roi function for investment analysis")
    .build(sdk)

```

**Function Design Principles**:

- **Type Safety**: Use proper type hints for parameters and return values
- **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error checking and meaningful error messages
- **Documentation**: Provide clear docstrings that explain function purpose and usage
- **Statelessness**: Design functions to be stateless for better scalability

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

For complex workflows, you might need multiple specialized agents working together:

```python
# Create specialized agents for different tasks
research_agent = create_agent("researcher", "Information gathering specialist")
analysis_agent = create_agent("analyst", "Data analysis specialist")
writer_agent = create_agent("writer", "Report generation specialist")

# Orchestrate workflow
def research_workflow(topic):
    # Research phase
    research_data = sdk.send_message_to_custom_agent("researcher", f"Research: {topic}")

    # Analysis phase
    analysis = sdk.send_message_to_custom_agent("analyst", f"Analyze: {research_data}")

    # Writing phase
    report = sdk.send_message_to_custom_agent("writer", f"Write report: {analysis}")

    return report

```

This approach allows you to:

- **Specialize Agents**: Each agent focuses on what it does best
- **Improve Quality**: Specialized agents often produce better results than generalists
- **Scale Independently**: Different agents can be scaled based on demand
- **Maintain Context**: Pass information between agents while maintaining workflow state

## Best Practices and Optimization

### Performance Considerations

**Agent Configuration Optimization**:

- **Temperature Settings**: Lower values (0.1-0.3) for factual tasks, higher (0.7-1.0) for creative work
- **Token Limits**: Set appropriate maximums to control costs while ensuring complete responses
- **Capability Selection**: Only enable capabilities your agent actually needs

**Resource Management**:

- **Session Cleanup**: Implement proper session termination to free resources
- **Caching**: Leverage built-in caching for frequently accessed data
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations when possible

### Security and Compliance

**Input Validation**:

```python
# Implement input validation in custom functions
def secure_function(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Validate and sanitize input
    if not user_input or len(user_input) > 1000:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")

    # Process safely
    return process_input(user_input)

```

**Access Control**:

- **Role-based Permissions**: Use session metadata to implement role-based access
- **Audit Logging**: Track all agent interactions for compliance
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure proper separation between different users or organizations

Each component builds upon the others to create a powerful, flexible platform for deploying AI agents in enterprise environments.

### Below are some complete usage examples for the agent creation.

    total_weight = sum(allocations.values())
    weighted_risk = sum(
        (weight / total_weight) * risk_scores.get(asset, 0.5)
        for asset, weight in allocations.items()
    )
    return {
        "overall_risk_score": round(weighted_risk, 2),
        "risk_level": "High" if weighted_risk > 0.7 else "Medium" if weighted_risk > 0.4 else "Low",
