# Session Management & Memory

## Understanding the Session Management Architecture

The Blackbird SDK's session management system represents a comprehensive framework for handling user interactions, maintaining conversation context, and managing resources across multi-user, enterprise-scale deployments. Unlike simple stateless chat interfaces, this system provides enterprise-grade session handling that includes user authentication, quota management, rate limiting, and sophisticated memory capabilities that enable agents to maintain context and learn from interactions over time.

**Enterprise Session Philosophy**: The session management system is built around the principle that enterprise AI deployments require robust multi-tenancy, security, and resource management. Each session represents not just a conversation, but a secure, isolated environment where users can interact with agents while the system maintains strict control over resource usage, access permissions, and data privacy.

**Hierarchical Memory Architecture**: The system employs a sophisticated multi-layered memory architecture that operates at different temporal and contextual scales. Short-term memory handles immediate conversation context, medium-term memory maintains session-specific knowledge, and long-term memory enables persistent learning and knowledge accumulation across sessions and users.

**Resource Management and Quotas**: Central to the session management philosophy is the concept that AI resources—computational power, token usage, storage, and API calls—are valuable and must be carefully managed. The system provides granular control over resource allocation, enabling organizations to implement fair usage policies, prevent abuse, and ensure stable performance for all users.

## Core Session Management Components Breakdown

### 1. Session Manager (`session_manager.py`)

The Session Manager serves as the central orchestrator for all user session activities, handling the complete lifecycle from session creation through termination while maintaining strict resource controls and security boundaries.

**Session Lifecycle Management**: Each session begins with a comprehensive initialization process that establishes user identity, allocates appropriate resources based on user tier and organizational policies, and creates isolated memory spaces. The manager continuously monitors session health, handles timeouts and cleanup, and ensures that sessions are properly terminated to prevent resource leaks.

**Multi-Tenant Resource Allocation**: The system supports sophisticated multi-tenancy where different users, departments, or organizations can operate within the same SDK deployment while maintaining complete isolation. The Session Manager enforces these boundaries, ensuring that one user's activities cannot impact another's performance or access to resources.

**Dynamic Quota Management**: Rather than static limits, the system supports dynamic quota adjustment based on usage patterns, organizational policies, and real-time resource availability. The manager can temporarily increase limits for priority users during peak demands or implement throttling when system resources become constrained.

**Advanced User Tier Management**: The system supports multiple user tiers—from free trial users to enterprise customers—each with different capabilities, resource allocations, and access permissions. The Session Manager automatically applies appropriate policies based on user classification and can seamlessly handle tier upgrades or downgrades.

## Core Session Features  Examples

### Session Creation and Management

```python
from blackbird_sdk import BlackbirdSDK
from blackbird_sdk.session.session_types import QuotaType, RateLimitType
# Initialize SDKsdk = BlackbirdSDK(development_mode=True)
# Create user session with specific tiersession = sdk.session_manager.create_session(
    user_id="user123",
    tier="pro",  # Options: free, basic, pro, enterprise    metadata={
        "department": "research",
        "project": "ai_analysis",
        "created_by": "admin"    }
)
print(f"Session created: {session.session_id}")
print(f"User ID: {session.user_id}")
print(f"Status: {session.status}")
```

```python
# Get session detailssession_data = sdk.session_manager.get_session_data(session.session_id)
print(f"Session Data: {session_data}")
# Check session statussession = sdk.session_manager.get_session(session.session_id)
if session:
    print(f"Session active: {session.is_active}")
    print(f"Age: {session.age_seconds} seconds")
    print(f"Idle time: {session.idle_seconds} seconds")
    print(f"Concurrent operations: {session.concurrent_operations}")
```

### 2. Session Types and Quotas (`session_types.py`)

The session types system provides the foundational data structures and policies that define how different types of users and usage scenarios are handled within the SDK.

**Comprehensive Quota Framework**: The quota system tracks multiple resource dimensions simultaneously: token consumption for AI model usage, API call volumes, storage utilization for files and memory, compute time for processing-intensive operations, and bandwidth for data transfer. This multi-dimensional approach ensures that no single resource can be exhausted while others remain available.

**Tier-Based Access Control**: Different user tiers receive dramatically different capabilities and resource allocations. Free tier users might have basic access with limited token usage, while enterprise users receive high quotas, priority processing, and access to advanced features like custom model training or specialized integrations.

**Rate Limiting Sophistication**: The system implements multiple types of rate limiting: per-second limits for burst protection, per-minute limits for sustained usage control, hourly limits for medium-term resource management, and daily limits for overall usage governance. This multi-timeframe approach prevents both sudden spikes and gradual resource exhaustion.

**Usage Pattern Analytics**: The session system continuously analyzes usage patterns to identify trends, predict resource needs, and detect potential abuse. This analytics capability enables proactive resource management and helps organizations optimize their SDK deployments for actual usage patterns.

#### Code Examples: Quota Management

```python
# Get all quotas for a sessionquotas = sdk.session_manager.get_quota(session.session_id)
print("Current Quotas:")
for quota_type, info in quotas.items():
    print(f"  {quota_type}:")
    print(f"    Used: {info['used']}/{info['limit']}")
    print(f"    Remaining: {info['remaining']}")
    print(f"    Usage: {info['usage_percentage']:.1f}%")
# Get specific quotaapi_quota = sdk.session_manager.get_quota(session.session_id, QuotaType.API_CALLS)
print(f"API Calls: {api_quota}")
```

```python
# Track usage for different operationsdef track_operation_usage(session_id, operation_name, resource_type, amount):
    """Track resource usage for an operation."""    try:
        success = sdk.session_manager.track_usage(
            session_id=session_id,
            operation=operation_name,
            resource_type=resource_type,
            amount=amount,
            metadata={"timestamp": time.time(), "operation": operation_name}
        )
        if success:
            print(f"✅ Tracked {amount} {resource_type.value} for {operation_name}")
        return success
    except QuotaExceededError as e:
        print(f"❌ Quota exceeded: {e.message}")
        print(f"   Used: {e.used}, Limit: {e.limit}")
        return False# Track different types of usagetrack_operation_usage(session.session_id, "send_message", QuotaType.API_CALLS, 1)

```

```python
class QuotaManager:
    def __init__(self, sdk):
        self.sdk = sdk
        self.usage_callbacks = []
    def add_usage_callback(self, callback):

            if usage_pct >= 90:
                warnings.append(f"{quota_type}: {usage_pct:.1f}% used")
            elif usage_pct >= 75:
                warnings.append(f"{quota_type}: {usage_pct:.1f}% used (warning)")
        return warnings
    def predict_quota_exhaustion(self, session_id):
        """Predict when quotas might be exhausted."""        # Get usage history        session_obj = self.sdk.session_manager.get_session(session_id)

        usage_history = self.sdk.session_manager.get_usage_history(
            session_obj.user_id,
            limit=100        )
        # Simple prediction based on recent usage patterns        # In production, this could use more sophisticated algorithms        predictions = {}
        for quota_type, quota_info in self.sdk.session_manager.get_quota(session_id).items():
            remaining = quota_info['remaining']

                        time_to_exhaustion = remaining / avg_rate

                            'predicted_exhaustion': time.time() + (time_to_exhaustion * 3600)

# Check quota statuswarnings = quota_manager.check_quota_status(session.session_id)
for warning in warnings:
    print(f"⚠️ Quota Warning: {warning}")
```

### 3. Memory Store (`memory_store.py`)

The Memory Store represents one of the most sophisticated components of the session system, providing both traditional caching capabilities and advanced vector-based memory that enables semantic understanding and retrieval.

**Dual-Mode Memory Architecture**: The system operates in two complementary modes: traditional key-value caching for fast retrieval of structured data, and vector-based semantic memory for understanding and retrieving information based on meaning rather than exact matches. This dual approach optimizes both performance and intelligence.

**Vector Embedding and Similarity Search**: The vector memory system automatically generates embeddings for conversation content, user preferences, and learned behaviors. This enables agents to retrieve relevant context even when users phrase requests differently or refer to previous conversations using different terminology.

**Intelligent Cache Management**: Beyond simple LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction, the memory system employs sophisticated algorithms that consider factors like information importance, user access patterns, and semantic relevance when deciding what to keep in memory and what to evict.

**Cross-Session Learning**: The memory system can be configured to enable learning across sessions, allowing agents to build cumulative knowledge about user preferences, common question patterns, and effective response strategies. This creates agents that become more helpful and personalized over time.

### 4. Event Source Manager (`event_source_manager.py`)

The Event Source Manager handles real-time communication and streaming interactions, enabling sophisticated real-time features like live responses, progress updates, and collaborative interactions.

**Server-Sent Events (SSE) Architecture**: The system uses SSE technology to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between agents and users. This allows for streaming responses, live updates during long-running operations, and immediate notification of system events or changes.

**Multi-Stream Management**: The Event Source Manager can simultaneously handle multiple concurrent streams for different types of events: chat message streams for ongoing conversations, progress streams for long-running operations like model training, and notification streams for system alerts and updates.

**Connection Resilience and Recovery**: The streaming system is designed to handle network interruptions, server restarts, and client disconnections gracefully. It automatically attempts reconnection, maintains message queues during outages, and ensures that no critical information is lost during communication failures.

**Stream Multiplexing and Prioritization**: When handling multiple simultaneous streams, the system can prioritize critical communications (like error notifications) over less urgent updates (like progress indicators), ensuring that important information reaches users promptly even during high-traffic periods.

### 5. Memory Types and Configuration (`memory_types.py`)

The memory types system provides the foundational structures and configuration options that define how memory operates across the entire session management framework.

**Configurable Memory Policies**: Organizations can configure memory behavior to match their specific needs: retention periods for different types of information, privacy policies for sensitive data, and sharing policies for cross-user learning. This flexibility ensures that the memory system can adapt to various compliance and organizational requirements.

**Embedding Model Integration**: The system supports multiple embedding models—from lightweight local models for basic semantic understanding to powerful cloud-based models for sophisticated language comprehension. Organizations can choose models that balance performance, cost, and privacy requirements.

**Memory Persistence and Backup**: The memory system can be configured for various persistence levels: pure in-memory for maximum performance, disk-backed for durability, or distributed storage for enterprise-scale deployments. Automatic backup and recovery capabilities ensure that valuable accumulated knowledge is protected.

## Advanced Session Management Features

### Enterprise Multi-Tenancy

The session management system provides sophisticated multi-tenant capabilities that enable service providers to support multiple organizations within a single SDK deployment while maintaining complete isolation and security.

**Tenant Isolation and Resource Allocation**: Each tenant receives completely isolated resources, memory spaces, and processing capabilities. The system ensures that one tenant's high usage cannot impact another tenant's performance, and that sensitive data remains completely segregated between organizations.

**Tenant-Specific Configuration**: Each tenant can have customized configurations: different model access, varying resource quotas, specialized integrations, and custom branding. This flexibility enables service providers to offer differentiated service levels while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Cross-Tenant Analytics and Reporting**: The system provides aggregate analytics across tenants while maintaining individual privacy, enabling service providers to understand usage patterns, optimize resource allocation, and identify opportunities for service improvements.

### Advanced Memory Capabilities

The memory system extends far beyond simple conversation history, providing sophisticated knowledge management capabilities that enable agents to build and maintain complex understanding over time.

**Semantic Knowledge Graphs**: The memory system can construct and maintain knowledge graphs that represent relationships between concepts, entities, and ideas discussed in conversations. This enables agents to make sophisticated connections and provide more intelligent, contextual responses.

**Temporal Memory Organization**: The system organizes memories with temporal awareness, understanding that information has time-sensitive relevance and that user interests and needs evolve over time. This temporal organization enables agents to prioritize recent information while maintaining access to relevant historical context.

**Collaborative Memory Sharing**: In enterprise environments, the system can be configured to enable controlled memory sharing between users or groups, allowing organizations to build collective knowledge bases while maintaining appropriate privacy and access controls.

### Real-Time Collaboration Features

The event source management capabilities enable sophisticated real-time collaboration features that transform single-user agents into collaborative platforms.

**Multi-User Session Support**: The system can support multiple users participating in a single session, enabling collaborative problem-solving, group decision-making, and shared research activities.

**Live Document Collaboration**: Users can collaborate on documents, analyses, or research projects in real-time, with agents providing intelligent assistance and suggestions as the collaboration progresses.

**Session Broadcasting and Monitoring**: Administrators can monitor session activities in real-time, enabling support, quality assurance, and security monitoring without disrupting user interactions.

#### Code Examples: Rate Limiting and Concurrency

## Integration Patterns

### Agent-Session Integration

The session management system seamlessly integrates with agent capabilities, enabling agents to leverage session context and memory to provide more intelligent and personalized interactions.

**Context-Aware Agent Behavior**: Agents automatically adapt their behavior based on session context: user tier, historical interactions, expressed preferences, and organizational policies. This creates personalized experiences that improve over time without requiring explicit configuration.

**Session-Persistent Agent Learning**: Agents can learn from session interactions and retain that learning for future sessions, building expertise in user-specific domains and developing more effective communication strategies based on what works for individual users.

**Cross-Agent Memory Sharing**: In multi-agent environments, the session system enables controlled memory sharing between agents, allowing specialized agents to build upon each other's knowledge and provide more comprehensive assistance.
